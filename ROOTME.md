> *Home of Forrest Manager and the Ranger Network, where magic-trees protect your projects using the power of TreeFS.*

Care for your files, elevate structure, and kick your relative paths in the face.  
Because you deserve a filesystem that knows where everything is—even after you move it.  
Welcome to Canopy.

## 🍄 What Is TreeFS?

TreeFS is a modular, self-aware filesystem framework that transforms how you manage folders, files, and project structure. It's not a plugin. It's not a framework. It's not even a tool in the traditional sense.

It's a **living memory system** for your codebase, your assets, and your chaos.

- Drop in a `tree.js` and a forest will grow around it.
- Every folder gains awareness through `branch.js`.
- Important folders declare themselves as `foundation branches`.
- Lost files don’t scream—they whisper to the tree.
- And if something breaks? `magic-tree.js` gently fixes it and leaves the old file tucked away in the dirt. 🌱

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| 🌳 Fruits            | 🌿 The Flavour                                                                                |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tree.js`            | The root memory of the project—holds the global map, tracks structure, logs history.          |
| `branch.js`          | A watcher agent in every folder—detects changes, reports to tree, updates `.sapling`.         |
| `foundation-branch`  | Important folders that anchor the project—can rebuild missing trees from memory.              |
| `.sapling`           | A lightweight local map of each folder’s structure—used to reconnect with the Tree if needed. |
| `dirt/`              | A gentle sandbox where old files go to rest safely—non-destructive by design.                 |
| `magic-tree.js`      | Proactively fixes broken paths and rewrites references.                                       |
| `monitor-tree.js`    | A non-destructive observer—reports problems but never touches a file.                         |
| `seed.js`            | A self-healing bootstrap tool to regenerate tree memory from distributed branches.            |

## 🧰 Forrest Manager & The Ranger Network

- **Forrest Manager** is your GUI or CLI companion—a sweet little app that lets you:
  - Plant trees
  - Monitor project health
  - Reorganize structure without breaking everything
  - Talk to your files like they’re part of something bigger

- **The Ranger Network** is an opt-in global registry:
  - Share anonymized structure data only
  - Receive smarter scaffolds and suggestions
  - Help your Tree grow stronger by joining the forest 🌍

## 🧙 Choose Your Tree Personality

When you plant a tree, you choose:

| Tree Type        | Behavior                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `monitor-tree.js` | A gentle observer—logs issues, suggests fixes, but changes nothing.     |
| `magic-tree.js`   | A proactive repair agent—rewrites broken paths, saves backups in `dirt/`. |

No pressure. No noise. Just choose your companion and go.

## 🧭 Translators

TreeFS isn’t just for JS projects or websites. It's a **structure-aware translator** too.

> “You gave TreeFS a finished React project... now you have a 75% completed Swift app scaffolded and ready.”

- React → Swift
- Vue → Svelte
- Web Archive → Blog
- Family Tree → Visual Explorer

Structure in, structure out. The files remember. The shape remains.

## 🌐 GroveNet (Coming Soon)

An optional shared intelligence layer.  
No content, no code—just structure.

> “300 other projects like yours had a `/cart`, `/checkout`, and `/products` folder.  
You might want one too.”

---

## 🫂 Become a Ranger

When you plant a tree, you’re asked:

> “Do you want to join the Ranger Network for this project?”

Opt-in per project. Share anonymously. Grow the ecosystem.

Because one tree is nice. But a forest? A forest protects itself.

## 💬 Final Words

You won’t find a `README.md` here.  
Readmes explain.  
**Roots remember.**

> So go ahead—plant a `tree.js`.  
Let the folders wake up. Let the branches sync.  
And watch your project grow.
